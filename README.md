# ImageOrientation
Predict the orientation of image with CNN

See idea in [this paper](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Publications/2015/FDB15/image_orientation.pdf).

## Description

In this project, we will be using the [CelebA](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.CelebA.html) dataset of celebrity faces.
We will first rotate the these faces, and then the label of images would be the rotation degree.
Therefore, the task would be regression.
